## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- SASS/SCSS
- JS


### What I learned

In this project, I continued to learn a lot more about using npm scripts for sass. I managed to formulate my own json file that fully builds html, sass, and js smoothly. This project was meant to build upon my JS knowledge and it certainly did. I learned more about event listeners because I wanted to implement extra keyboard functionalities for the counter that were not taught in the course.

### Continued development

Still want to keep learning more about JS, best practices, how to be more efficient, less repetition, etc.
